{{!
    This partial is rendered below the `footer`-partial of the page. It includes the
    javascript-bundle generated by `customize-engine-uglify`. If you don't want to
    include the javascript-bundle, because you do not require the bootstrap-javascript,
    you can override this partial with an empty one.
